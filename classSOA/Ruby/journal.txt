I have finished tryRuby.com today.
There is a lot of commands.
I can't understand some commands.
I will pratice twice and ask my classmate tomorrow.

Since I've praticed tryRuby.com twice,
I think Ruby language is not familiar to me.
I also found the are many people share the knowledges in how to use Ruby.
It's a great way self-learning.
I think I used more examples to practice and make in better.

1.輸入irb進入Ruby之中，每次結束都會自動幫你puts輸出結果 
2.ruby 檔名.rb，會幫你儲存成ruby檔案 
3.任何整數都是Fixnum物件，ex.1000，整數四則運算後還是整數 
4.中間有點號就是浮點數，ex.0.05 
5.數用雙引號或單引號就是字串String，puts "Hello,world!" 字串相加可以使用加號，但是不可以跟數字加在一起會錯 
puts var1.reverse # 'pots' 
puts var2.length # 6 
puts var3.upcase 
puts var3.downcase
