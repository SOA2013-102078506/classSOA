Feature name: Response as a buyer
As a User of the Service [buyer],
So that I can help others and buy the product for them and improve my reputation,
I want to buy requested products for others
Scenario: Help other to buy products I can carry
Given I am on the Request Content page
Then I should see "Buy" button
And I press that button
When I finish the required information on the “Buy for a Request” page
Then I should see my profile picture on the “Request Content” Page
And I should see the quantity showing how much I can buy for
